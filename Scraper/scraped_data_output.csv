New Zealand-based Halter makes “smart collars” for livestock that ranchers can use to manage herds instead of building physical fencing infrastructure. It wasn’t the only virtual fencing company to turn heads last quarter: Nofence, which has developed a similar system, closed a $35 million round shortly after Halter’s. Those were two in a handful of bright glimmers against an otherwise-gloomy funding backdrop for agrifoodtech. Investment numbers across categories are still falling, dropping another 32% to $1.7 billion in the third quarter of 2025 compared to Q2 2025, according to preliminary data from AgFunder.

Markets Stocks Funds Investment Trusts ETFs Bonds Sustainable Investing Topics Tools United Kingdom We’re watching a new trend in semiconductor stocks concerning circular deals. Here’s why we think investors should be keeping an eye on it, though they shouldn’t be particularly worried at this point. What Is a Circular Deal? Quite simply, these are deals between two or more parties where funds are flowing back and forth.

The partnership can be considered circular, as OpenAI will likely buy gear from Nvidia, which will reinvest those profits in OpenAI, which will likely use those funds to buy even more Nvidia gear. Nvidia’s partnership and investment with CoreWeave CRWV is also circular, or perhaps more of a web. CoreWeave funded some debt using Nvidia’s GPUs as collateral. Nvidia ow"
