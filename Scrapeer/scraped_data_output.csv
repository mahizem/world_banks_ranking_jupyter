New Zealand-based Halter makes “smart collars” for livestock that ranchers can use to manage herds instead of building physical fencing infrastructure. It wasn’t the only virtual fencing company to turn heads last quarter: Nofence, which has developed a similar system, closed a $35 million round shortly after Halter’s. Those were two in a handful of bright glimmers against an otherwise-gloomy funding backdrop for agrifoodtech. Investment numbers across categories are still falling, dropping another 32% to $1.7 billion in the third quarter of 2025 compared to Q2 2025, according to preliminary data from AgFunder.

        Announcing Our Top 10 Cloud Trends For 2025 Back in ancient history — that is, before the debut of ChatGPT in 2023 — cloud was a sleepy space. Top trends rarely made headlines, and the pace of change had slowed. In 2021 and 2022, cloud had largely settled into the norm. The biggest conversations centered on rising cloud bills and how to rationalize them. Announcements were modest, often focused on data center buildouts rather than innovation. The future of cloud felt less like a frontier and more like a continuation — a vision of executing modernization journeys that had already been long underway. Not anymore. These days, big cloud AI announcements dominate the business press and move stock markets on a regular basis, with players like Microsoft and NVIDIA playing a role as capital entities with big investments in neoclouds such as CoreWeave and Nebius as well as OpenAI .

        Are You Running Consumer Personalization Programs? We’d Like To Hear From You! Consumers are lukewarm about personalized interactions with organizations. But 88% of marketers feel that delivering relevant and valuable personalized experiences is “somewhat” or “very” important to their marketing success, according to Forrester’s Q3 2025 CMO Pulse Survey. And this business sentiment extends beyond the marketing department to the entire organization. Today, organizations grapple with how to satisfy customer needs and internal business priorities. They require an organizationwide vision centered on the customer and deep customer research, followed by internal execution consisting of strategy , data , technology , and measurement .

A graduate of Johnson & Wales University’s baking and pastry program, D’Agostino began his hospitality career in food and beverage, working as a line cook for Marriott before climbing the operational ladder into management roles with several hotel operators. His early experience balancing food costs, labor expenses, and guest satisfaction became the foundation for a career-long philosophy: that data-driven decisions should span every part of a hotel, not just rooms.

Mintel’s GNPD reveals that the percentage of global food and drink products with a high or added protein claim has doubled in the past ten years (client-access only), whereas high or added fiber claims have remained relatively flat. While protein consumption gets plenty of encouragement from brands and health experts alike, fiber intake remains disappointingly low across most populations.

Here’s why we think investors should be keeping an eye on it, though they shouldn’t be particularly worried at this point. What Is a Circular Deal? Quite simply, these are deals between two or more parties where funds are flowing back and forth. The most notable recent example is Nvidia’s NVDA partnership with OpenAI, wherein Nvidia can invest up to $100 billion in the firm over time. The partnership can be considered circular, as OpenAI will likely buy gear from Nvidia, which will reinvest those profits in OpenAI, which will likely use those funds to buy even more Nvidia gear. Nvidia’s partnership and investment with CoreWeave CRWV is also circular, or perhaps more of a web. CoreWeave funded some debt using Nvidia’s GPUs as coll"

Following the launch of OpenAI’s invite-only, video-generating mobile app last week, Apple’s App Store was flooded with fakes that also proclaimed themselves to be “Sora” or “Sora 2” — the latter a reference to the underlying new AI video model that was released alongside the mobile app. These apps somehow made it past Apple’s App Review process. They actually had public listings on the App Store, despite using a brand name that’s trademarked by OpenAI and fairly well known in the tech industry even before the app’s debut.

Reports about Netflix’s efforts to bring its mobile games to televisions began in early 2023. Later that year, the company launched a game controller app for iOS devices. However, there hadn’t been much word about gaming on the big screen until now, but it looks like the wait is finally over. To use the new feature, go to the Games tab on the Netflix TV app, then pick a game and use your phone as the controller. Since launching mobile games four years ago, Netflix’s strategy has been somewhat varied. However, the recent move indicates a more serious commitment to expanding its gaming offerings, helping it compete "

The technique, called Model Merging of Natural Niches (M2N2), overcomes the limitations of other model merging methods and can even evolve new models entirely from scratch. M2N2 can be applied to different types of machine learning models, including large language models (LLMs) and text-to-image generators. For enterprises looking to build custom AI solutions, the approach offers a powerful and efficient way to create specialized models by combining the strengths of existing open-source variants. What is model merging? Model merging is a technique for integrating the knowledge of multiple specialized AI models into a single, more capable model. Instead of fine-tuning,"
